Hi my name is BRAIDEN GOLE favourite programming languages are "Python" & "C". I 
 like these languages a lot because they are both unique
 in their own way.
 
 I use both languages to tackle different problems
 for the really BIG tough problems I use the (C) programming
 language and for smaller to medium sized programs python is usually
 my goto. Either way (C) and Python are great languages.
 
     This passage is just a {text filler} like a lorem ipsum.

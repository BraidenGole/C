# Practice_C

This repository is just for the sake of practicing (C) I will compile g++ and have the extension .cpp of all files but use (C)
syntax.

Content from this repository does not 100% represent what I would submit to an organization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some changes to almost all files:

  - Over-commented (On purpose)
  
  - Comments that are likely to be irrelevant.
  
  - Variables sometimes stacked in a pool, it would be stacked
    vertically in which order they are defined.
    
  - One line IF statements for example: if (myVar == 2) { return 0; }
  
  and some other smaller details.
